# SVG Map Generator

Node.js based tool to convert complex GeoJSON/TopoJSON to annotated SVG for use in [SVG Mapper](https://github.com/economia/svg-mapper).

Work in progress, ETA: mid June.

## Intended use

When your work is too large to be rendered in-browser with GeoJSON. When you wish to draw a [Choropleth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) with rules that would be too complex for [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/).
